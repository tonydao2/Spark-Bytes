# DS209 Course Project: Spark Bites


Spark Bites is a platform for Boston University students and faculty members to post events that provide foods or snacks. The aim is to reduce food waste resulting from over-purchasing for events and at the same time, help students access free food.

## Installation Guide

### Client
Navigate to client folder, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

### Server
Navigate to server folder, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

You need to create a `.env` file before you start the API or the database. Create a file called `.env` in the server folder, and add the following lines:
```
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public"
JWT_TOKEN_SECRET=asupersecretthing
```

You also need to setup the database, run `docker compose up -d` to start the database server.

You must use run the database migrate script to setup the database tables. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` to setup the 
database tables.

Now you are ready to start the server: `npm run dev`. Will start the server, it will also auto-reload when you make changes.
## Features

- **Hosting:** Currently undecided for client-side, but considering Netlify.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (setup in progress).

## Directory Structure
